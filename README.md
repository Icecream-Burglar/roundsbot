# Roundsbot README #

## Introduction ##
Roundsbot is a very, very specific discord bot for [RBWhitaker's](http://rbwhitaker.wikidot.com/) discord.



### Prerequisites ###
.net Core 2.0 is required for running the bot.

## Getting Started ##
`dotnet run` in the project's directory and it will run.
The first run will create a conf.json.
You must enter the bot's token in the 'token' entry in this config file.

Once you've got the bot running, the first channel you send a command in
will forever be the only channel the bot listens to. This is stored in the conf.json.

## Commands ##
#### @roundsbot help ####
Will print out all the commands.

#### @roundsbot start ####
Starts running rounds.

#### @roundsbot stop ####
Starts running rounds.

#### @roundsbot uptime ####
Displays the length of time the bot has been online.
